Css Notes:

    Somewhere the padding is set to 40px on the left of the ul element. I have no clue where it is lol and I even tried ctrl + f on it
    as well by looking for '40' and 'padding' but nothing showed up lol. Have no idea why this is, maybe 40px padding to left is default
    for ul elements. Anyways, am I thankful for webdev tools to help me look at whitespace on pages. Saved my life and other people from
    a simple headache on stackoverflow lol.
    That was written last night(writing this as of 3/1/2024). Apparently each browser has their own custom css so this is like with
    margin and padding for body where you have to set them to zero. I have no idea why the body margin and padding being set to zero
    doesn't set the padding of this element to 0. Well, more tidbits to remember to help
            
    Default font related css for the whole doc has to go into an html selector

    All other general doc styling will go into body
    Rem is a responsive measure unit based off html font-size so it has to go into a body selector.

Html Notes:
    note to self, when using id's in js, make sure to check if the id pops up on not only elements of the same type, but other nodes as well such as forms.
    made form id addtask and input addtaskinput cause it was an ez change

Js notes:
    display checkboxes function commented at end of js cause I wanted to add checkboxes a while back but couldn't figure it out and got
    sidetracked by another feature I wanted to implement
